Tools for Analysing EAGLE simulations


Current version uses the functions in newetools.py, which is in development and not yet complete. The older and more clunky eagletools.py contains functions for saving haloes, and making various plots for single halos.

import the module by using
```
import newetools as et
```
in the directory containing the .py file.
